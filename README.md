### Hey there 👋

I recently was a data scientist at Andela, where I worked on trying to solve matching talent to IT opportunities. I contributed to a recommender system project, worked on topic modeling and sentiment anaylsis for survey responses and was in charge of building a target dataset as well as defining features for a talent responsiveness model to predict the likelihood of someone applying to a job given an invite in order to reduce unnecessary matcher reach outs estimated to up to 20%.   

I'm a graduate 🎓 from the Applied Data Science Master degree program at the University of Michigan. I have over 4 years of combined Python SQL and C++ programming experience. I enjoy interdisciplinary team collaboration, building complete pipelines, models, and analyzing and visualizing the results.         

🏃‍I weaved my way into data science non-traditionally. Started as a Biochem major and transitioned into Physical Therapy, working in the field for over 10 years! I developed an interest in data during this time, especially how data collected in iPhone accelerometers could be used to help people perform rehabilitation exercises more effectively. 

🧮 I decided to finish my math sequence by taking multivariate calculus and linear alegbra, learn programming by taking data structures and algorithms in C++ as well as brush up on statistics and probability at local community colleges. 

👶 I took a work break to raise two young children while going back to school for my master's in data science and now that I have graduated, 
I am looking to relaunch my career in data science and have plans to take it as far as I am able. 

🖥️ I developed an interest in deep learning specifically with computer vision building convolutional neural networks and GANs for image
data. My goal is to achieve success in this area of data science, but still continue to build an expert understanding in all areas of 
machine and deep learning.
