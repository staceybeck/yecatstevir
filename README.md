### Hey there 👋

I'm Stacey Beck, a recent graduate 🎓 from the Applied Data Science Master degree program at the University of 
Michigan! I have over 4 years of combined Python SQL and C++ programming experience. I enjoy interdisciplinary team collaboration,
building complete pipelines, models, and analyzing and visualizing the results.         

🏃‍I weaved my way into data science non-traditionally. I started out as a Biochemistry major at Ithaca College and 
transitioned into Physical Therapy, receiving my masters and working in the field for over 10 years! I know a lot about Kinesiology and
the Musculoskeletal system. I developed an interest in data during this time, especially wondering how data collected in iPhone accelerometers 
could be used to help people perform rehabilitation exercises more effectively (biofeedback mechanisms). 

🧮 I decided to finish my math sequence by taking multivariate calculus and linear alegbra, learn programming by taking data structures and algorithms in C++ as well as brush up on statistics and probability at local community colleges. 

👶 I took a work break to raise two young children while going back to school for my master in data science and now that I have graduated, 
I am looking to relaunch my career in data science and have plans to take it as far as I am able. 

🖥️ I developed an interest in deep learning specifically with computer vision building convolutional neural networks and GANs for image
data. My goal is to achieve success in this area of data science, but still continue to build an expert understanding in all areas of 
machine and deep learning. 

💼I am currently looking to break into my first data science role, humbled to learn and eager to face the challenges that help me grow in this discipline.
